# Usage

The most basic usage of HTML5 Boilerplate is to create a static site or simple
app. Once you've downloaded or cloned the project, that process looks something
like this:

1. Set up the basic structure of the site.
2. Add some content, style, and functionality.
3. Run your site locally to see how it looks.
4. Deploy your site.

Cool, right? _It is_. That said, the smart defaults, baseline elements, default
attribute values and various other utilities that HTML5 Boilerplate offers can
serve as the foundation for whatever you're interested in building.

Even the basic use-case of a simple static site can be enhanced by manipulating
the code through an automated build process. Moving up in complexity HTML5
Boilerplate can be integrated with whatever front-end framework, CMS or
e-commerce platform you're working with. Mix-and-match to your heart's content.
Use what you need (toss it in a blender if you need to) and discard the rest.
HTML5 Boilerplate is a starting point, not a destination.
